### Welcome To Open-source Graph-Algorithm 

This repository will include object oriented classes of Dynamic-programming algorithm.
This is an open-to-all repository, where we encourage, students, teachers, developers, professionals, beginners, intermediates and experts : everyone, to come and code.

### HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

1. Star the repository
2. Claim an Issue by commenting on it to get assigned. **DO NOT RAISE A PR BEFORE YOU HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED. YOUR PR WILL STAND INVALID.**
3. Fork it
4. Clone the forked repository in your local system
5. Add the upstream (the original repository from which you forked is the upstream)
6. Checkout to a new branch for every PR you make. The PR should be the name of the algorithm, say: ```dijkastra```
7. All contributions must be under ```src``` directory.
8. Start contributing !

**REMEMBER :** 
  - The file name must be the name of the your Class of model. Say the Dijkstra problem. So, your file name should be : ```Dijkstra_Class.cpp```

HAPPY CONTRIBUTING !!
